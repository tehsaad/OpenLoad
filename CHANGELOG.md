### Added
- HTTP/HTTPS download engine on libcurl: probing, resumable single-connection transfers, and segmented multi-connection transfers with verified assembly.
- Safe resume with `Range`/`If-Range`, exact `Content-Range` validation, and restart when the server ignores ranges or the file changed.
- Task state machine (Queued, Downloading, Paused, Completed, Failed, Cancelled) with rejected invalid transitions.
- Automatic retry with bounded exponential backoff for transient errors only.
- Priority + FIFO queue, concurrency limit, start/stop queue, move up/down.
- Daily scheduler with optional stop time and a documented missed-start policy.
- Global bandwidth limit, re-balanced across running downloads.
- SQLite persistence with migrations, and startup recovery of interrupted downloads.
- Optional SHA-256 verification against a trusted checksum.
- Qt 6 Widgets UI: Dashboard, Add Download dialog, Download Details, Queue & Scheduler, Settings; dark and light themes; original icon set.
- Command line: `--add <url>`, `--minimized`.
- Local deterministic HTTP test server and six test suites; segmented-download benchmark tool.
